Notifications.js
- Querying the DOM for state
- functions that have multiple responsibilities
- DOM and service tightly bound
- code is very easy to introduce bugs into
- components directly referencing each other
- component management and update is micromanaged in this controller

Advantages that Redux and reactive components bring
- Responsibility is completely separated
- Developers can work in parallel according to a contract
- Mirrors backend development against APIs
